# About{-#Usage}
Tick tock tick tock...
have you been gating for the past 10 days sieving through multiple .fcs files
and secretly wished theres a quicker method than flowjo?
Well then, here's it for you! it may not be the best method out there
so do your own diligence in the QC parts! especially the gating plots.
But i reckon that it will be easier sieving through flowjo windows.
